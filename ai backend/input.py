    Processes an uploaded document and prompt, simulating a backend endpoint.

    This function takes in-memory file content (as bytes), saves it to a 
    temporary file, uploads it to Google Cloud Storage, saves the prompt
    to Firestore, and then cleans up the temporary file.

    Args:
        file_name (str): The original name of the uploaded file (e.g., "contract.pdf").
        file_content (bytes): The raw content of the file.
        prompt (str): The user's text prompt.

    Returns:
